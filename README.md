# EEG-CDA-Review
We've reviewed 8 EEG CDA related papers and tried to reproduce their results with a minimalist CDA pipeline. We used the same Python pipeline for all studies in an attempt to extract the CDA.

### Missing Files
For some reason Git on Mac ends up in a dead end for some .ipynb files :/
I will try later to find a solution to upload them on GitHub.
